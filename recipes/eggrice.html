        <dt>Step 1: Prepare the Rice</dt>
        <dd>Begin by cooking the rice according to package instructions. For best results, 
            use slightly cooled rice that has been cooked and fluffed earlier, or you can 
            use leftover rice from a previous meal.</dd>

        <dt>Step 2: Scramble the Eggs</dt>
        <dd>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large skillet or wok, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.</li>

            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them until well combined.</li>
            
            <li>Pour the whisked eggs into the hot skillet. Allow them to cook undisturbed for about 30 seconds until the edges begin to set.</li>
            
            <li>Gently scramble the eggs with a spatula, breaking them into small, soft curds. Continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes, or until the eggs are just set. Remove them from the heat and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
